### Abstract: 
              We applied machine learning to predict which of COVID-19-related papers will be highly cited, yielding an extension for the Covid-on-the-Web knowledge graph. Symbolic and deep-learning (BERT) ML performed comparably. LIME-based explanation is also included as part of the produced graph.
